# GDELT Media & Issue Metadata
Here are two datasets that can help researchers enrich and provide structure to GDELT GKG Data (https://www.gdeltproject.org/data.html#rawdatafiles)

## GDELT Media Categories
GDELT injests a ton of different websites, spammy SEO blogs, PR newswires, and of course a ton of news media. Because it's a bit of a soup, we've created media lists that fit categories academics tend to study: elite media, wire media, traditional news media, online partisian media, and emerging media.

To address this problem, we created a series of lists for these categories. To view these media categories, see GDELT sources.ipynb

## GDELT Themes to Issues
GDELT is great in that it searches the text of articles and looks for specific themes. For a list:
http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GDELT-Global_Knowledge_Graph_CategoryList.xlsx

GDELT makes it easy to know what themes are inside of a news event (e.g., a collection of news articles).

The problem is that these themes are a bit too granular for broader public opinion studies that often study issues (e.g., the economy).

To address this problem, Lei Guo and I created a list of GDELT themes that taken together broadly represent "issues." To access the list, see GDELT Issues.ipynb
